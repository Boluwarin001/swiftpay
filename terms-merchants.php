Disclaimers and Limitation on Liability
<br>
	•	The Site and Services are provided “AS-IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” and we (and our Merchants) expressly disclaim any warranties and conditions of any kind, whether express or implied, including the warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, quiet enjoyment, accuracy, or non-infringement. We (and our Merchants) make no warranty that the Site or Services: (a) will meet your requirements; (b) will be available on an uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free basis; or (c) will be accurate, reliable, free of viruses or other harmful code, complete, legal, or safe. Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so the above exclusion may not apply to you.
	<br>
	•	In no event shall we (and our Merchants) be liable to you or any third party for any lost profit or any indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental, special or punitive damages arising from or relating to this Agreement or your use of, or inability to use, the Site or Services, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. Access to, and use of, the Site and Services are at your own discretion and risk, and you will be solely responsible for any damage to your computer system or loss of data resulting therefrom. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, our (and our suppliers’) liability to you for any damages arising from or related to this Agreement (for any cause whatsoever and regardless of the form of the action), will at all times be limited to the greater of (a) fifty us dollars ($50) or (b) amounts you have paid SwiftPay in the prior 12 months (if any). The existence of more than one claim will not enlarge this limit. Some states do not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental of consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you and you may also have other legal rights that vary from state to state.
Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
<br>
	•	This Agreement shall be construed and governed solely and exclusively in accordance with the Laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 2004 (LFN 2004), without giving effect to any law that would result in the application of the law of another jurisdiction. In case of a dispute between SwiftPay and its users or a third party logistics provider, this Agreement requires the use of arbitration on an individual basis to resolve disputes, rather than court trials or class actions, and also limits the remedies available to you in the event of a dispute. The Arbitration and Conciliation Act CAP A18 LFN 2004 will govern the arbitration procedure, the place of arbitration shall be Lagos, Nigeria and the language shall be in English
